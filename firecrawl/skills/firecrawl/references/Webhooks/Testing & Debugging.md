# Testing & Debugging

> Tools and techniques for developing and debugging webhooks

This page covers tools and techniques for testing webhook integrations during development and debugging issues in production.

## Local Development

### Exposing Local Servers

Since webhooks need to reach your server from the internet, you'll need to expose your local development server publicly.

#### Using Cloudflare Tunnels

[Cloudflare Tunnels](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) provide a free way to securely expose your local development server to the internet without requiring account registration or opening firewall ports:

```bash  theme={null}
# Download cloudflared from GitHub releases or use a package manager

# Expose your local server
cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:3000

# Example output:
# Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
# https://abc123.trycloudflare.com
```

Use the provided URL in your webhook configuration:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "url": "https://abc123.trycloudflare.com/webhook"
}
```

## Debugging Common Issues

### Webhooks Not Arriving

1. **Check URL accessibility** – Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible
2. **Verify HTTPS** – Webhook URLs must use HTTPS
3. **Check firewall settings** – Allow incoming connections to your webhook port
4. **Review event filters** – Ensure you're subscribed to the correct event types

### Signature Verification Failing

1. **Check the secret key** – Ensure you're using the correct secret

2. **Verify raw body usage** – Make sure you're using the raw request body:

```javascript  theme={null}
// ❌ Wrong - using parsed body
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
  .digest('hex');

// ✅ Correct - using raw body
app.use('/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(req.body) // Raw buffer
    .digest('hex');
});
```
